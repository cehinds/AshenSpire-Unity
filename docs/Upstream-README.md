# AshenSpire — Ashen Spire

A roguelike deckbuilder for the browser — single-player, with optional LAN co-op. Mechanically faithful to **Slay the Spire**, thematically inspired by (but legally distinct from) **Elden Ring**. Built with vanilla ES-module JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — no framework, no build step.

> **Status: feature-complete core loop.** Four classes, three acts, three bosses, seeded and save-resumable end to end. See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) to run and extend it.

> **README content updated:** 2026-09-05T15:10:06-08:00 (Alaska)
> **Updated by:** Claude Code, on the owner's instruction — the feature list described only the four painted class figures, and equipping armour now changes the animated figure you fight as
> **Source change:** #648, which gave each of the twelve alternative armour sets its own painted figure in combat and in the Armoury, with the class figure as the fallback, and added a fourth attack frame
> **Scope:** README content-currentness only; not QA, merge, deployment, playability, release, publication, or approval status.

## Play a build

**[Play AshenSpire in your browser](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/AshenSpire.html)** — the stable
build from `main`. **[Every build, by branch](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/)** — the builds
index: the current `dev`, `test`, `release` and `main` builds, each playable at its own address.

### Playable builds and where each comes from

| Branch | Role | Build number (live, derived) | Play | Changelog |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | stable — the classic Play link serves this | [![main build](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcehinds%2FAshenSpire%2Fmain%2Fbuildordinal.json&query=%24.ordinal&label=main%20build&color=8a4b1f&cacheSeconds=600)](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/main/) | [play latest](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/main/latest/) · [all `main` builds](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/main/) | [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cehinds/AshenSpire/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) |

| `test` | QA — the dev→test promotion under independent test | [![test build](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcehinds%2FAshenSpire%2Ftest%2Fbuildordinal.json&query=%24.ordinal&label=test%20build&color=8a4b1f&cacheSeconds=600)](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/test/) | [play latest](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/test/latest/) · [all `test` builds](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/test/) | [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cehinds/AshenSpire/blob/test/CHANGELOG.md) |
| `dev` | integration — merged work lands here first; unreviewed | [![dev build](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcehinds%2FAshenSpire%2Fdev%2Fbuildordinal.json&query=%24.ordinal&label=dev%20build&color=8a4b1f&cacheSeconds=600)](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/dev/) | [play latest](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/dev/latest/) · [all `dev` builds](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/dev/) | [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cehinds/AshenSpire/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md) |

The badge reads each branch's committed `buildordinal.json` — the number is never typed
here. It is the last segment of the stamp the game paints on its title screen,
`BUILD <version>.<ordinal> · src <digest>` (for example `BUILD 0.4.0.1688 · src b258350c3d`
on `main`), so the number on the badge, the number on the builds index and the number on
the title screen are the same fact read from the same file.

**Read each badge down its own column, not across.** The ordinal counts builds *within the
current candidate* and restarts when the candidate advances, so the four numbers above are
not a ranking: a freshly cut candidate on `dev` starts near zero while `main` still carries
the count it was promoted with. `main` also predates the restart — it is on the `0.4.0` line
and still counting globally, which is why its badge reads in the thousands. To compare two
branches, compare the whole stamp (`BUILD <version>.<ordinal>`), which the builds index and
the title screen both show; the badge is a per-branch progress counter only.

**Address scheme.** `https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/<branch>/<ordinal>/` is that exact
build — `…/main/1688/` is `main` build 1688, byte-identical to the `AshenSpire.html` of the
commit that produced it — and `…/<branch>/latest/` is the branch's newest. Each entry on the
index links the `CHANGELOG.md` **at that build's commit**, not at a moving branch head. The
site is assembled from git history by `node tools/pages-site.mjs` in the `pages-builds`
workflow on every push to one of the four branches; nothing on it is hand-edited.

**Publication is split by branch.** A push to `dev`, `test` or `release` assembles the site,
proves it, and publishes it — those three keep themselves current without anyone asking.
A push to **`main` publishes nothing**: the stable Play link changes only on the repository
owner's own dispatch of that workflow with its `publish` input spelling PUBLISH, which
publishes whichever branch it is run from. Because Pages serves one site and this one is
assembled on top of `main`'s tree, a `main` change does reach the site on the next
`dev`/`test`/`release` publication after it lands; what a push to `main` never does is
publish itself. Merging to `main` is owner-only in the first place.

**[AshenSpire Project #4](https://github.com/users/cehinds/projects/4)** owns
workflow status. **[Status & Daily Briefs](https://github.com/cehinds/AshenSpire/issues/183)**
is the readable projection, with timestamped updates and Daily Briefs.

**[AshenSpire UI Component Catalog](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/docs/component-catalog.html)** —
the interactive reference for stable component IDs, model and renderer names,
live visual specimens, and reuse surfaces. UI delivery summaries list the exact
changed IDs; an origin-bound UI change updates both catalog formats in the same change.

**[QA Testing](docs/QA-TESTING.md)** and the
**[feature delivery loop](docs/FEATURE-DELIVERY-LOOP.md)** — the repeatable
design, build, responsive playtest, evidence, and documentation process used for
player-facing changes. The current Smith modal write-up is
[here](docs/qa/2026-08-25-smith-modal-design.md).

**[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** — what changed, newest first, each entry
naming the pull request that landed it and the build number it shipped in.

**[Working rules](AGENTS.md)** — how contributors and AI agents work here:
one task per branch, draft pull requests into `dev`, and only the owner merges
to `main`.

**[Architecture map](docs/ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md)** — the stable
composition/component redesign contract. The [current-`dev` architecture
snapshot](docs/ARCHITECTURE-CURRENT-DEV.md) is refreshed automatically after
every push to `dev` without rewriting the core contract.

The stable Play link publishes the repository-root `AshenSpire.html` from `main`
and follows the newest reviewed development build after GitHub Pages finishes
deploying it; the builds index above serves the other branches' current builds
beside it. This is a **development preview**, not a release, tag, or
production approval. Release status remains governed separately and is currently
**RED**.

Work reaches `main` only when the owner merges it. `dev` is the integration
branch, and since #632 a push to it publishes the builds site, so a change
merged to `dev` appears at its own `dev/` address once that run finishes. What
it does not do is move the stable Play link above, which follows `main` and is
published only on the owner's own dispatch.

For offline play, download [`AshenSpire.html`](AshenSpire.html) from the
repository root and double-click it. It is a self-contained file and requires
no installation.

The root file is a discoverability alias for [`dist/AshenSpire.html`](dist/AshenSpire.html).
Both are generated from [`build/AshenSpire.html`](build/AshenSpire.html) by
`node tools/launch.mjs --build-only`, and `node tools/verify-shipped.mjs` fails if
either copy differs from that build. The file is development evidence, not a
release declaration; release status remains governed separately.

## Current development screenshots

These canonical images are captured from the exact `dev` tree by
`node tools/screenshot.mjs`. Regenerate and review them whenever the development
build changes; the visible build stamp ties each image to the tree that drew it.

## UI component library

Use the [AshenSpire component catalog](docs/component-catalog.html) for the
stable component IDs, model/factory names, renderers, reuse surfaces, and a
distinct visual miniature for every component. Select any component card for its
detail drawer; the [Folding Tray gallery](docs/tray-gallery.html) shows every
top/right/bottom/left folded and unfolded state. The [Markdown catalog](docs/COMPONENT-CATALOG.md) is the
chat-friendly reference. The [component model architecture](docs/COMPONENT-MODEL-ARCHITECTURE.md)
defines the model, renderer, host, behavior, service, and infrastructure
boundaries used as screens migrate. The [Folding Tray contract](docs/TRAY-COMPONENTS.md)
defines the shared Top, Right, Bottom, and Left disclosure grammar. The
[Armoury layout contract](docs/ARMOURY-LAYOUT-BRIEF.md) and
[asset-component index](docs/ASSET-COMPONENTS.md) name the exact Character,
Armaments, Inventory, Cards, Stats, card-hold, comparison, and resizing
surfaces shown in the current build. Any merge or PR that changes a UI element
or component must update the interactive and Markdown catalogs in the same
origin-bound change and include `Changed catalog components: <id...>` plus this
catalog link in its summary. If the surface has no stable ID, add one first.

The catalog now decomposes the complete title flow as reusable families:
`startup-gate` contains the transparent-on-phone folded mark, deterministic ash,
wordmark, subtitle, divider, and input-family prompt; `title-menu` contains the
six centered actions and their selection ornament; and `title-menu-modal`
contains the shared Load/New heading, slot list, slot receipts and states,
hold-to-delete control, and Back/Continue action group. Reference captures:
[folded wide](docs/preview/startup-folded-wide-1440x900.png),
[folded phone](docs/preview/startup-folded-mobile-390x844.png),
[title wide](docs/preview/title-menu-wide-1440x900.png), and
[Load phone](docs/preview/title-load-mobile-390x844.png). Catalog QA is recorded
at [title-family wide](docs/preview/component-catalog-title-wide-1440x900.png)
and [startup-family phone](docs/preview/component-catalog-startup-mobile-390x844.png).

## Playing

**One-click (recommended):** double-click **`run.bat`** (Windows) or run **`./run.sh`**
(macOS/Linux). This builds the standalone into `dist/`, serves the live app on
`http://localhost:8080`, and opens it in your browser. Requires
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (used only as a tiny static server + bundler — no
packages to install).

**Standalone file:** grab **[`AshenSpire.html`](AshenSpire.html)** from the root
(or the byte-identical [`dist/AshenSpire.html`](dist/AshenSpire.html)) — the
entire game compiled into one self-contained HTML file. Double-click to play,
no server needed. (External music folders need http; see [dist/README.md](dist/README.md).)

**Manually:** open `index.html` via any static server:

```
node tools/serve.mjs      # zero-dependency, opens the browser
# or
npx serve .
# or
python -m http.server
```

No install, no framework, no build step for the source.

## What is this?

- **A run:** pick a class → traverse a branching map across 3 acts → fight enemies with a deck of cards → collect relics, flasks, and cinders → beat the final boss or die trying (seeded, reproducible runs).
- **Four distinct classes:** Reaver leads with strike damage, Rogue with defense and actions, Starseer with magic, and Herald with a balanced martial-support kit. Their starting attributes and equipment are data-owned and validated through the shared character-creation flow.
- **One component kit, and one run HUD built from it:** every screen is drawn from one kit of shared pieces — one meter, one swatch, one page door, one modal chrome with the same way out in the same corner — rather than each screen carrying its own. Map and Combat compose the same model-driven header, vitals, Quick Access, relic, and potion components from that kit. Stable IDs and tuning tokens are documented in the component catalog so UI changes name the exact surface they affect.
- **One data-driven Armoury:** Character, Inventory, and Hybrid are presentations of the same equipment owner. Character places the contained figure beside expandable Combat Power, Attributes, and Relics; Inventory pairs procedural Armaments with the one shared carried-item list; Hybrid keeps the compact Character stack beside Armaments. Armaments, Inventory, Cards, and Stats use the shared Folding Tray grammar. Equipment cards drag as one surface and, when hold-confirm is enabled, fill across the whole folded or expanded card while equipping, moving, or unequipping. The fixed authored attack slots rebind in place to the active weapon package: a lone left- or right-hand weapon owns all of them, dual wield splits them right-first without deck growth, and the comparison receipt shows the exact before/after counts.
- **You can re-arm during a fight:** the combat Armoury lets you equip, move, or remove carried weapons and armour on your turn, instead of limiting you to the sets prepared beforehand. Re-arming a position costs the same Energy as switching a prepared weapon set, and the change lands immediately — equipment cards, HP/MP/SP limits, Poise, and the item in each position all update inside the current fight, and the new loadout stays with you when the fight ends. A change you cannot afford is refused without spending Energy or moving anything.
- **Every card has an owner, and a smith can change it:** a card your equipment lends you belongs to that item. Take the weapon or the armour off and its cards leave with it; put it back and they return — mid-fight and across a save, not only on the Armoury screen. At a Shrine, and at a merchant who rolled a smith, **Extract a Card** lifts a card out of the item that lends it and makes it yours for good, and **Seat a Card** puts one of your own into an open mount. An emptied mount is never dead: it shows a fallback — the Dodge Roll for a weapon-art mount — until something else is seated. Which cards can be lifted is a tag on the card, and the price and who offers the service are tables, so both change without code. No shipped weapon authors a card package yet, so until content does, the smith will tell you there is nothing to work on.
- **The deck cap is a creation rule:** the starting deck size governs the basic strikes and defends dealt at character creation, and nothing else. The cards your equipment brings are dealt first and are never capped or dropped, and after creation the cap does not apply at all — your deck floats with your gear, by design.
- **Painted class figures, in the builder and in the fight:** the figure you pick at character creation is the painted concept design for that class, and it is the same figure you fight as — cut from the owner's pose sheets, animated when you attack, and turned to face whoever it is fighting. Your tint colours the garment rather than just the outline, keeping the painting's own light and shadow. **The armour you equip changes that figure:** each of the twelve alternative armour sets has its own painted figure in combat and in the Armoury, and a set without one falls back to the class figure rather than leaving you without a figure at all. The attack plays four frames, the forward thrust landing before the downward slash. These figures were made with AI image-generation models; the game's AI disclosure and CREDITS say so.
- **The battlefield answers what you point at:** hover a status effect, land the focus cursor on it, or tap it, and it says what it does and how far its build-up or countdown has run; the build-up bars under an enemy answer the same way. Hover or tap either fighter — yours included — for the glance: HP, Poise and effects, with **I** for the full read. When a card is armed, a tap on a target is still a play.
- **Faithful StS mechanics:** 3 energy / draw 5 turns, block that expires, telegraphed enemy intents, exhaust/ethereal/retain keywords, exact StS damage-order math.
- **Elden Ring flavor with real mechanics:** Bleed as a build-up meter that bursts for %-max-HP damage, Crimson Blight as a non-decaying timed DoT, and a Poise/Stagger system that skips enemy turns and opens damage windows.
- **Equip load and Weight Class:** what your hands and armour weigh counts against a capacity set by Constitution and Strength, and the percentage lands you in Light, Medium or Heavy. The Armoury shows the load, the capacity and the class, and comparing a piece shows the load and class the swap would leave you at.
- **Stamina, and hands that fight empty:** a turn in which you spend no Stamina recovers some at its end, and the Dodge Roll checks Dexterity against a d20 to land a temporary guard. Its price is your Weight Class — Light 1 Stamina, Medium 2 Stamina and 1 action, Heavy 3 Stamina and 2 actions — quoted the same way on the card face, in the tooltip and by the engine. An empty hand brings the Dodge Roll to your deck: with one hand armed the armed hand keeps its own technique, with both hands empty every guard slot is Evasive Guard and every technique slot the Dodge Roll. A shield counts as a full hand.
- **Quests that remember what you did:** an event choice is written into your run's history, and a quest step your history has not earned is kept out of the event pool entirely. Earn it and it becomes eligible at the Unknown nodes of maps built after that — a chance the map rolls, not a node that opens on cue — and a step you have already answered never comes back. The Grave of the Nameless is the first chain: dig for cinders and the keeper may come to collect, or pay your respects and be thanked with the Gravetender's Bell, a relic no shop or drop will ever hand over.
- **Forsaken Together — LAN co-op:** a party shares one map, votes on the fork and fights one shared combat, each seat playing its own deck, relics and flasks. Events are answered seat by seat, and a seat that drops out comes back to a catch-up queue that replays what it missed against the choices its history had earned at the time. Served by the launcher's own Node server, so a `file://`-opened build stays single-player.
- **Character creation, one panel at a time:** six folded picks — class, starting kit, keepsake, sigil, tint, sprite — each pick opens the next, and the column reads your choices back in words. Below them, **starting armour** and **stat points** sit open as rows of their own: both change the run, so neither folds, and editing them never marches you on to the next section. Mouse, keyboard, and pad all walk the same flow; pressing Confirm repeatedly accepts the defaults.
- **Rewards you open before you collect:** post-fight spoils are a menu — cinders, cards, flasks, armaments, relics — and nothing joins your run until you take it, so you can look first and back out unchanged. A reward you have no room for says so on its own row, and is the only row that offers Skip. Continue is always pressable; Settings → Advanced → Reward collection decides whether it sweeps up the rest for you or simply means *done*.
- **A merchant who buys back:** the shop is five collapsing bars — cards, relics, flasks, remove-a-card, and Sell — one open at a time. He buys back relics and flasks at half his own cheapest price, and the Sell bar can be switched off entirely in Settings.
- **An in-game development changelog:** Settings → Changelog reads the repository changelog as concise expandable rows, while development build stamps link back to the exact source repository and release-shaped standalone files remain inert.
- **Responsive browser play:** portrait and fitting short-wide landscape layouts stay playable down to 340 CSS pixels high; smaller viewports show a clear, recoverable short-screen warning instead of a clipped board — a warning that reads whole even at the largest accessibility text size. Fullscreen is one toggle, first under Settings → Display.

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** | Combat vertical slice — Reaver class, 24 cards, Act 1 enemies + elite + boss, full combat UI | **shipped** |
| **M2** | The run — map generation, rewards, relics, flasks, shops, events, save/continue, seeds | **shipped** |
| **M3** | Content — Rogue, Starseer & Herald classes, Acts 2–3, full relic/event pools, balance pass | **core content shipped**: 4 classes, 3 acts, 40 relics, 10 events, ~30 cards/class + colorless, first balance pass ([BALANCE.md](docs/BALANCE.md)). Deeper pools (~50) & win-rate tuning await playtest telemetry (M4) |
| **M4** | Polish — fx, run history, keyboard shortcuts, asset pass | **shipped**: fx, customization, run-history + win-rate telemetry, keyboard shortcuts (1–9 / E / Esc), first-run tutorial, sfx hooks, DEVELOPER.md walkthroughs + perf notes, placeholder art tuned across all acts. Bundling real external art/audio is a deliberate v1 deferral (SPEC §11 non-goal) — the generated-placeholder system is the shipped visual style |

Acceptance criteria per milestone are in [SPEC.md §9](SPEC.md).

## Branches

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable, playable. Only receives merges from `release`. |
| `release` | Release staging — final checks before merging to `main`. |
| `dev` | Integration branch. Feature branches merge here. |
| `test` | Balance/playtest experiments that may never ship. Branched from `dev`. |
| `feature/*` | One branch per unit of work (e.g. `feature/m1-combat-slice`), branched from `dev`, merged back via PR. |

Flow: `feature/* → dev → release → main`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
