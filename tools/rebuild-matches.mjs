// tools/rebuild-matches.mjs — does a build from THIS source reproduce the
// committed build/ ?
//
// ---- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL --------------------------------------------
//
// It was a row in the family repo's release floor (F22), and Sten found what
// that meant: *a check living outside the tree it protects.* He also proved it
// is not a spare — it is the ONLY door onto a defect class Vira named at
// ce4f171, head source with a bundle imported from somewhere else. He rebuilt
// that case at dev and watched the other three doors stay green:
//
//     verify-shipped        exit 0        build == dist  (both foreign)
//     artifact-provenance   "same commit"
//     THIS                  RED
//
// The reason generalises and is worth keeping in front of whoever edits this:
// THE OTHER THREE ARE RELATIONAL — committed against committed. A bundle that
// came from elsewhere is invisible to every one of them BY CONSTRUCTION,
// because both copies are consistently foreign together. This one is
// GENERATIVE: it makes a new artifact from the source in front of it and asks
// whether the committed one could have come from here. Nothing else in the tree
// does that, and a relational check can never be widened into one.
//
// ONE HOME EACH, and this file is deliberately narrow. `dist` equals `build` is
// tools/verify-shipped.mjs check B and is NOT restated here — Sten's own
// correction, after his first version of this command carried a `-- build dist`
// whose dist half COULD NOT FIRE (bundle.mjs writes OUT_DIR = build/ only). A
// dead token in a command is the class he spent that night removing from other
// people's instruments. This owns build/. That is the whole of it.
//
// ---- WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT MEAN ----------------------------------------
//
// Printed by the tool itself, not only here, because a suite that prints only
// PASS is "green wasn't clearance" shipped as infrastructure.
