// tools/armoury-arrival-figure.mjs — WHAT THE ARMOURY GIVES THE FIGURE ON
// ARRIVAL, measured in pixels at two shapes.
//
// Constantine's ruling, 2026-08-21: *the Armoury opens with the figure, and
// CARDS is one click away.* The cost he accepted, stated to him plainly:
// someone browsing loot now pays a click every visit. This tool is the edge
// that ruling is proved against — before and after, same probe, both shapes.
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHY IT IS THE FIGURE'S BOX AND NOT THE SPRITE'S.
// `.armoury-figure` is the container the layout sizes; `.equipped-figure`
// inside it is the art, and #305's compositing mirror
// (`.class-sprite > .facing, .equipped-figure { transform: scaleX(-1) }`,
// guarded by `.class-sprite .equipped-figure { transform: none }`) lives on
// THAT element. The class figure's half of that rule moved off `.class-sprite`
// onto a facing layer inside it — an element that carries the facing and
// nothing else, because `.class-sprite` is also an animation target — which
// changes nothing here: `.equipped-figure` is what this tool reads, and it
// still carries its own mirror.
// A transform changes a client rect. So both are read, and the mirror is read
// as a COMPUTED transform on each of them — this tool goes red if a change
// creates a second mirror or cancels theirs, which is the hazard of making the
// figure bigger while #305 is live in the tree.
//
// TWO SHAPES, AND THE PHONE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS.
//   1440x860  desktop — where the squeeze was found
//    390x844  phone   — where `data-layout='narrow'` is on, and where a panel
//                       that reads fine at 1440 can leave the figure or the
//                       cards unreachable
// The tree settles layout by `data-layout` on the root element, NOT by media
// query, so the shape is set with device metrics and the attribute is READ
// back rather than assumed — a probe that assumed it would report on a
// desktop layout wearing a phone's pixel count.
//
// COST, MEASURED AND NOT QUOTED. "One click away" is checked as an actual
// click count AND as whether the cards land above the fold once opened: a
// click plus a scroll is not the cost he was told.
//
// WHAT IS GATED vs WHAT IS ONLY REPORTED — stated here because the first two
// versions of this file printed four numbers and asserted two of them, and a
// printed number reads as a checked one. Codex found both gaps at `e5fe1dd`;
// two non-author verdicts had passed this probe without asking whether it
// asserted what it printed.
//   GATED    figure arrives whole (where the view declares one) · CARDS arrives
//            COLLAPSED, on every shape · one click actually EXPANDS it, to a box
//            with AREA, ABOVE THE FOLD · the fold round-trips · #305's mirror is
//            the literal single matrix where a figure is declared — ZERO mirrors
//            fail it, which they did not until Codex found that at `b9b3e81`
//   REPORTED stripFullyVisible — false at `dev` and at head alike, a pre-existing
//            scroll this change neither adds nor removes. Labelled in the output
//            so it cannot be mistaken for a gate.
//
// DOOR. Source tree, repo's own tools/serve.mjs, real Chromium through
// tools/browser.mjs's CDP path. NOT tools/screenshot.mjs — its one-shot flags
// print trailing blank rows and exit 0, so a green from it means nothing.

// DESKTOP reports `data-figure=0`, so every figure and mirror assertion is skipped
// and the run exits green — with the figure gone from the exact screen D99 is about.
// Planted and confirmed: `view=rack data-figure=0 … all gates green`.
//
// The phone is the ONLY shape whose figurelessness is expected, and it is expected
// because `narrowDefaultView` opens `rack`, whose whole job is `figure: false`. So
// the expectation is stated HERE, per shape, and asserted BEFORE `data-figure` is
// allowed to excuse anything — the same move Vira made in `foldsurvivors`: do not
