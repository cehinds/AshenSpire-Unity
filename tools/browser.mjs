// tools/browser.mjs — THE ONE HOME FOR "START A BROWSER AND TAKE ITS PROFILE
// WITH YOU". Every tool that launches Chromium goes through here.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (Law 0, and Law 1 clause 7 is its sharpest instance).
// Measured on this tree at b968e28: 37 tools under tools/ pass their own
// `--user-data-dir`, 36 of them mkdtemp it, and SIX MORE launch Chromium with
// no `--user-data-dir` at all. That is 43 homes for one act. The pile it made,
// measured 2026-08-17 with `/` at 89%: /tmp holding 22 GB across 3612 entries —
// 167 `creationbrief-*`, 23 `ttpersist-*`, and 2208 `/tmp/.org.chromium.Chromium.*`.
// Restarts killed two seats today. This is not tidiness; it is the thing that
// stops the next restart.
//
// THE TWO LEAKS ARE ONE LEAK, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A JUDGEMENT.
// Probed at this ref, three runs, each in a private empty TMPDIR, counting what
// the run left behind by construction:
//
//   no --user-data-dir at all        -> 2 x /tmp/.org.chromium.Chromium.* stranded
//   --user-data-dir, TMPDIR default  -> profile removed, 1 x .org.chromium.* STRANDED
//   --user-data-dir, TMPDIR pinned
//     to the profile directory       -> NOTHING. Chrome's own scoped temp lands
//                                       INSIDE the profile and dies with it.
//
// So the 2208 directories are not a second lane. They are the same act missing
// the same home, and both halves close here: this launcher ALWAYS gives Chrome
// a private profile, and ALWAYS points the child's TMPDIR inside it.
//
// WHAT "REMOVED" MEANS HERE, AND WHY THE OLD ANSWER WAS NOT ONE.
//   * `child.kill()` is a signal, not a join. The previous best-in-tree cleanup
//     (creationbrief.mjs, patched 2026-08-17) waited on `exit` OR 3000 ms,
//     whichever came first, and on a loaded box the timer won: three of five
//     clean runs left a 1.1 MB PARTIAL still holding `SingletonLock`. Here the
//     join is real — SIGTERM, wait, SIGKILL, wait — and it has no short bound
//     that lets the removal start early.
//   * `try { rmSync(...) } catch { /* tmp */ }` is not a removal, it is a wish.
//     `rmSync` walks a tree Chrome may still be writing, the top-level rmdir
//     fails ENOTEMPTY, and the catch eats it. A PARTIAL REMOVAL REPORTS NOTHING.
//     Here the verdict is the POSTCONDITION — `existsSync(profile)` after the
//     call — never the absence of a throw, and a failure is printed BY NAME.
//   * Every early exit after the mkdtemp used to leak the whole ~11 MB profile:
//     no try/finally, no exit handler. Here the profile is registered before
//     the browser is spawned and swept by `exit`, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP and
//     SIGQUIT. An interrupted run is the ORDINARY shape of the ones that made
//     the pile, not the exotic one.
//
// A JANITOR MAY NOT HOLD VERDICT POWER. A failed removal is printed loudly and
// does NOT change the caller's exit code — a screen check reports on the screen.
// Set `BROWSER_LEAK_STRICT=1` to make an unremoved profile exit 3; the selftest
// below runs that way, which is where this can go red.
//
// ATTRIBUTION: A SET DIFFERENCE OVER SHARED /tmp IS APPEARANCE, NOT ATTRIBUTION.
// Bjorn's finding, and it is why every number in this header came through a
// private TMPDIR: run two seats' tools in the same second and the diff reports
// the other seat's directory as yours. `mkdtemp` respects `os.tmpdir()`, so
// `TMPDIR=<short empty dir>` makes a leftover this run's BY CONSTRUCTION.
// Keep it SHORT — the profile holds `SingletonSocket`, a UNIX socket path is
// capped at 108 bytes, and an over-long TMPDIR means Chrome never comes up.
// `launchBrowser` refuses a profile path over PATH_BUDGET.
//
// AND THAT REFUSAL DOES NOT COVER THE BAND IT SAYS IT COVERS — measured by
// Bjorn gating this file, and the sentence is narrowed to the measurement
// rather than kept. It read "rather than handing you a browser that
// mysteriously does not start"; between 62 and 90 bytes it hands you exactly
// that. Ladder, `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`, profile path built to an exact
// length, twice each, same door as every other number here:
//
//   pinTmp ON   58 / 60 / 61 -> LAUNCHED, wsUrl, removed
//   pinTmp ON   62 .. 90     -> Chrome dies SIGTRAP with no endpoint. LEGAL by
//                               the guard (<= 90), dead in fact, and the error
//                               names the BINARY, not the path.
//   pinTmp OFF  66 / 70      -> LAUNCHED. 80 / 90 -> SIGTRAP.
//
// So the real ceiling under the pin is 61, not 90, and the pin — the mechanism
// that closes the 2208 — is what costs the ~10 bytes: it puts Chrome's own
// scoped temp INSIDE the profile, and those paths are longer than
// `SingletonSocket`. With the longest prefix in tools/ (`arcane-exposure-visual-`,
// 23 bytes + 6 of mkdtemp + a slash) a WORKING TMPDIR is 31 bytes, not 83.
// `/home/user/AshenSpire-bjorn-g6` is 30. An ordinary seat setting TMPDIR to
// their own clone directory is one byte inside the cliff for that tool and over
// it for the next, and PATH_BUDGET is silent for all 29 bytes of the band.
// THE NUMBER IS THE PREDICATE AND THE PREDICATE IS VIRA'S — not narrowed here
// (MR-101), and no plant is left behind red on it. A card is owed: move the
// budget to the measured ceiling, or measure `SingletonSocket` and the pinned
// temp path separately and refuse on the longer one.
//
// SELFTEST: `node tools/browser.mjs --selftest` (needs CHROME). Eight
// scenarios, each in its own private TMPDIR, each asserting the leftover SET.
// The control is a clean run leaving nothing; the plants are a throw after
// launch, SIGINT, SIGTERM, an early process.exit, a launch that never yields an
// endpoint, a removal made to fail, and — as the pair either side of the TMPDIR
// pin — one run with pinning ON (nothing left) and one with it OFF (a
// `.org.chromium.Chromium.*` left, named). A check born red is a check nobody
// keeps, so the removal was made whole first and the plants were watched after.
//
// WHAT THE EIGHT COULD NOT SEE, AND ONE OF THE TWO IS FIXED HERE (Bjorn):
//   * FIVE OF EIGHT PASSED AGAINST A LAUNCHER THAT LAUNCHED NOTHING. Watched:
//     `launchBrowser` replaced by a stub returning no profile and no child ->
//     5 PASS / 3 FAIL; the same five also passed when the import failed to
//     resolve at all. Every one of them asserted only `leftover: 'none'`, and an
//     empty directory is what you get either way. REPAIRED: each scenario that
//     expects a launch now asserts a receipt — a browser launched, with its
//     profile INSIDE that scenario's private TMPDIR, which is also what makes
//     the leftover count attributable. Re-watched, both edges: real launcher
//     8 PASS / 0 FAIL, the same stub 0 PASS / 8 FAIL where it used to be 5/3.
//   * THE GROUP KILL HAS NO PLANT — see signalGroup. Stripping it leaves the
//     suite green. Not repaired here: a plant for it would have to reproduce a
//     ~2.5%-per-run race, and a check that flakes is worse than a named gap.
//
// AND THE LAUNCHER CLOSES THE SOURCE IN THIS TREE ONLY — measured on this box
// while gating, 2026-08-17 07:21 UTC. Seven top-level Chromiums alive, all
// reparented to init: six hold PRE-MIGRATION profiles (`placement-*`,
// `creationbrief-*`, aged 3 h 09 m to 4 h 45 m, all older than this commit), and
// the seventh — pid 7245, no `--user-data-dir` at all, `--headless=new`,
// `--remote-debugging-port=9396` — is the OLD `profile-first-run.mjs` spawn line
// verbatim, from a checkout that has not taken this commit. Nothing in this tree
// can spawn that: every launch here passes `--user-data-dir` and `--no-first-run`.
// So the door is shut where it is installed and every unmigrated worktree on the
// box is still a source until it pulls. That is a fact about clones, not a defect
// in this file, and it is why the pile keeps growing after tonight.
//
// BOUNDARY. Linux, headless Chromium 141, one box. Nothing here is measured on
// Windows or macOS; `SIGKILL` and the socket budget are POSIX assumptions.
// This file owns the PROFILE. It does not own the http server a caller starts,
// the CDP socket, or any sandbox tree a tool copies — those are the caller's,
// and this launcher is silent about them. It also does not own BROWSER
// RESOLUTION: `resolveBrowser()` is exported and is the single home available,
// but the tools' candidate lists genuinely differ (CHROME vs CHROME_PATH, four
// paths vs three), so migrating resolution is a second act and is not claimed.
//
// REMOVAL: deleted the day no family tool launches a browser, or the day the
// tools use a real browser-automation library that owns its own profile
// lifetime — at which point this is a second copy of that library's job.

/**
 * SIGNAL THE WHOLE PROCESS GROUP, NOT THE BROWSER PROCESS.
 *
 * THE WORD WAS "DETERMINISTIC" AND IT IS NARROWED, BY COUNTING (Bjorn, gating
 * this file — and I prescribed this mechanism before it was measured, so scoring
 * it is scoring my own prescription and the reader should weigh it that way).
 * Re-derived here: this launcher is 96/96 clean at 12-way concurrency (36 + 60,
 * private TMPDIR per run) and the selftest is 8/8 three times. But a 2x2 over
 * the two mechanisms this file credits — the group signal, and removeTree's
 * settle-and-recheck — cannot tell them apart, and cannot license the word:
 *
 *   both (as shipped)          60/60 clean
 *   group signal stripped      60/60 clean   <- and --selftest still 8 PASS / 0 FAIL
 *   settle/recheck stripped    60/60 clean
 *   NEITHER (~the first cut)   57/60 — three profiles left with close()
 *                              reporting removed=true and exit 0. The silent
 *                              partial, reproduced. Then 60/60 on the RE-RUN of
 *                              the same mutant.
 *
 * So: the defect is real and watched; the fix is right; and the population that
 * could contradict "deterministic" fails at ~3/120 with a re-run of ZERO. At
 * that rate 44 clean runs — the evidence this shipped on — would be expected
 * about a third of the time FROM THE BROKEN SHAPE. What is licensed is the
 * count, not the word, and NEITHER mechanism alone failed in 60 trials: which of
 * the two did the work is `unknown` and needs a denominator nobody has spent.
 * The 0/8 comparator is a different and larger claim — that shape had no exit
 * guard, no real join, a swallowed catch AND no TMPDIR pin, and the pin alone
 * strands a `.org.chromium.Chromium.*` on EVERY run (P7). 0/8 measures the pin.
 *
 * With `child.kill()` alone — the shape every tool in
 * this tree uses — ten concurrent runs left ONE profile behind, 16 KB holding a
 * fresh `Default/`, and `close()` reported SUCCESS and exited 0. `existsSync`
 * was false when it was asked: the tree really was gone, and then an ORPHANED
 * RENDERER RECREATED IT. Chrome's children are not `child`; killing the browser
 * leaves them writing. So the launcher spawns `detached: true` (the child
 * becomes a group leader) and signals `-pid`, which reaches every one of them.
 *
 * A consequence, stated because it changes behaviour: a detached child no
 * longer receives the terminal's Ctrl-C on its own. The SIGINT handler below
 * kills the group explicitly, so the coverage is the same and it is now
 * deterministic instead of incidental.

// ⚠ ONLY WHEN THIS FILE IS THE COMMAND, and the second clause is a bug fix

// This line used to read `if (process.argv.includes('--selftest'))`, at module
// scope, in a file **24 other tools import**. Every one of them declares its own
// `--selftest`, and every one of them ends in `process.exit` from THIS
// function before its own bench is reached. Measured at dev `b83bda1`:
//
//     node tools/mapfog.mjs --selftest   ->  "browser --selftest: held — 8 PASS"
//                                            exit 0, and the fog ladder's nine
//                                            properties and nine mutants never
//                                            ran at all.
//
// **IT IS THE WORST SHAPE A GREEN CAN HAVE**: the documented command for an
// instrument printed somebody else's pass, under a different tool's name, and
// exited 0. Nothing was wrong with either tool — the import ran the wrong bench.
//
// WHAT THIS FIXES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It fixes the hijack. It does NOT
// discharge the 23 other benches this was hiding: each of them has now been
// unreachable by its own command for as long as it has imported this file, and
// **not one of them has been run in that state**. That is a finding for the
// table, not something this commit may claim as covered.
