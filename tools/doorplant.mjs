// tools/doorplant.mjs — the same-door selftest harness: plant a known-bad in a
// COPY OF THE REAL TREE, run the tool whole from that copy, watch it go red.
//
// WHY. Vira's doors audit (docs/TOOL-DOORS-AUDIT.md, vira/the-doors-audited,
// 2026-08-14) classified 37 asserting tools with no re-runnable red and named
// the recurring defect: a plant handed to the acceptance predicate downstream
// of the readFileSync / import / serve road the real input travels. The
// instrument rule's same-door clause (commons/development.md, family repo):
// the known-bad must enter where the real input enters, and the check states
// its door in its own output. This harness is the one home of that mechanic
// for the tools that read THIS TREE — closedsets.mjs proved the pattern
// (plants written into a copied real tree on disk, read back through the same
// collect()); this generalizes it to a whole-tool subprocess run.
//
// WHAT IT DOES, per plant:
//   1. copies the real tree (src/, content/, styles/, tools/*.mjs, index.html)
//      to a scratch dir — the copy IS a runnable checkout;
//   2. edits the named file in the copy — the plant enters as FILE BYTES in
//      the same file the real defect would live in;
//   3. runs `node tools/<tool>` with cwd = the copy, so every stage the real
//      run performs (readFileSync, import graph, serve.mjs, the browser boot
//      for browser tools) runs against the planted bytes;
//   4. requires a non-zero exit AND an output line matching the plant's
//      expected red — a red for the wrong reason is NOT a catch;
//   5. restores the pristine bytes (the revert is discarding the edit; the
//      real tree was never touched), and finally re-runs CLEAN, which must be
//      green — both edges, every time.
//
// A plant whose find-string no longer exists is a HARD RED (`plant site
// drifted`), never a skip — a corpus that silently stops running is the
// eleven-instruments shape (gracerefill's legacy corpus, the same audit).
//
// HARNESS, not a check: this file asserts nothing about the game. Its callers
// do. It is exercised — observed red — every time a tool's selftest runs,
// because a NOT-CAUGHT plant exits 1 by this file's own hand.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: deleted the day the suite runner grows a per-test door
// harness that subsumes it, or the last tool selftest importing it is deleted.

/**
 * plants: [{ name, file, find, replace }] or [{ name, file, append }]
 *   file    — repo-relative path the real input lives in
 *   find    — exact substring that MUST exist in the copy (else hard red)
 *   replace — its replacement (the defect)
 *   append  — text appended to the file instead (the defect arrives at EOF)
 *   edits   — [{ file, find, replace, all } | { file, append }] for a defect
 *             that is genuinely more than one file. Use INSTEAD of file/find.
 *   prep    — [[cmd, ...argv]] run in the copy AFTER the edits and BEFORE the
 *             tool; each must exit 0 or the plant is a hard red.
 *   expectRed — RegExp the failing run's output must match
 * args: extra argv for every tool run (e.g. ['--only', '390x844'])
 * Returns an exit code: 0 all plants caught + clean green, 1 otherwise.
 *
 * `edits` AND `prep` ADDED 2026-08-15 (Viki, MR-41) — the same-door clause taken
 * literally rather than stretched:
 *
 *   · A CSV CONTENT DOOR HAS TWO STAGES. An author edits `content/source/*.csv`
 *     and runs `node tools/content-build.mjs`; the game imports the generated
 *     module. A plant that stops at the spreadsheet never reaches the runtime,
 *     and one typed straight into `src/content/generated/*.js` has entered
 *     BELOW the door — it is the compiler's output written by hand. `prep` is
 *     that missing stage, and the house was already doing it by hand:
 *     statusreach's DOOR block records *"…then `node tools/content-build.mjs`
 *     recompiled"* as a dated one-off, which SOP 2's drift clause rots to
 *     `unknown` at the next ref. This makes that observation re-runnable.
 *   · SOME DEFECTS ARE TWO FILES, AND SPLITTING THEM PLANTS NEITHER. A
 *     presentation bug that can only fire on content nobody has authored yet
 *     needs the content row AND the code. Either half alone is green for a
 *     reason that has nothing to do with coverage — which this file already
 *     calls a false NOT-CAUGHT (see `all` below, the same argument one level
 *     down).
 *
 * Both are opt-in and change nothing for existing callers. Falsifier (SOP 1's
 * corollary, counted not judged): cut them if no plant ever needs a second file
 * or a compile — then they are decoration.
