// Variant D was a second composition: its own grid areas, its own control cell,
// its own absolute rail for Fullscreen/Music, its own 18×2 px dash. The HUD is
// one kit Band now (styles/kit.css `.as-band`), and compact is that Band FOLDED
// — `data-hud-mode="compact"` hides whatever the composition marked `.fold`,
// which is one statement in one place instead of thirty overrides. So these

// D8 WAS "Fullscreen/Music are in the same cluster as Armoury and the Menu".
// They are not in the band at all now (owner, 2026-09-05: "the full screen and
// music buttons don't need to be there since we have it in the quick and main
// menu settings"), so this asserts the two things that make that safe, which is
// more than the original did:
//   · the run HUD mounts no quick-settings pair — no import, no interpolation,
//     and `quickAccessPanelHtml` takes no options bag that could carry one back;
//   · Settings still carries BOTH controls, so neither affordance is stranded.

// correct while another surface offers it, and this is what would catch someone
// later removing the Settings rows and leaving no fullscreen anywhere.

// the first draft looked for `quickSettingsHtml` anywhere in the file, and the
// COMMENT explaining the removal contains that word. A contract a comment can
// fail is a contract that punishes documentation. It reads CODE shapes now — the
