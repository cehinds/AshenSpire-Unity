// ── THIS TOOL GATES, AND UNTIL 2026-08-15 NOBODY HAD WATCHED ITS GATE GO RED ──
// Vira's doors audit (docs/TOOL-DOORS-AUDIT.md, 2026-08-14) filed this file under
// HARNESS — "not a check; asserts nothing; the rule has no claim on it". That is
// wrong and it is my own file, so the correction is mine: `--gate` exits 1 on
// three named classes (NEW, REGRESSED, BLIND) and is a check by every definition
// in this house. It belonged in the NO-KNOWN-BAD column, which is where the
// P-BATCH deal would have found it. The one red anyone ever watched here was
// Vira's, on the #45 branch, before the profile map existed — ref-pinned, so
// `unknown (drifted)` ever since (SOP 2's drift clause).
//
// --selftest is the re-runnable replacement: it edits a REAL PALETTE TOKEN in
// styles/base.css, serves the real tree, renders in the real browser, captures
// real pixels, and requires the gate to name the rows that fell. Nothing is
// handed to the ratio function.
//
// Why this reads pixels and not the stylesheet: a declared colour and a
// delivered colour are two different facts. `.card .ctag` specs 4.67:1 at 8px —
// and its brightest RENDERED pixel reaches 3.36:1, because at that size every
// glyph pixel is antialiased and NONE of them attains the declared colour. So
// this reports two numbers per target and they are allowed to disagree:
//
//   spec   — computed `color` composited onto the rendered backdrop. What the
//            palette promises. This is the number a stylesheet audit finds.
//   render — the glyph pixel furthest in luminance from that backdrop. What a
//            tired human at 11pm actually receives.
//
// `render` is the honest one, and it is the one `--gate` fails on. When
// render << spec, no palette change fixes the target: the size does.
//
// Zero dependencies (house rule). Chromium is driven over raw CDP through
// node's global WebSocket; the PNG is decoded by handing it back to the page as
// a data URL and reading it off a canvas — the browser already owns a decoder.
//
// Removal condition (development.md SOP 1 corollary): delete this file the day
// the accessibility palette stops being hand-audited — i.e. when a CI workflow
// runs the same matrix per commit, or when the family stops shipping a
// contrast-sensitive default. A hand-run check nobody runs is decoration.

  //  · TITLE SCREEN (no ?shot=) — a normal boot. localStorage is the store, so
  //    seeding sote_meta_v1 before any page script is exactly what a returning

  //    applyDisplaySettings is called at module top level and a post-load write
  //    would measure the wrong body.
  //  · ?shot= SCREENS — gated onto the memory stub since #8, so sote_meta_v1 is
  //    NEVER READ and every display setting resolves to its default. The seed
  //    below reached none of them: nine profiles rendered one identical frame and
  //    this tool reported the differences it had asked for. `?shotSettings=`

  //    writes the same settings into that same ephemeral store, so the app

// fills its own box (so the modal colour IS the ink and the ratio reads 1.00),
// a `.hint` contains a `<kbd>` child (so the "furthest pixel" is the child's
// text, not the target's), and a `.ctag` has a tinted fill and a border inside
// its box. Differencing needs no guess:
//

//                backdrop — which is what they are. (The 🩸 in a card tag is
//                not palette-governed: `color: transparent` doesn't move it.
//                Measuring the emoji instead of the word "Blood" would flatter
//                the tag by ~1.5 points.)

//   spec     — declared colour vs the median backdrop under the ink. The

//   render   — the BEST-formed ink pixel. Generous to the game on purpose: if
//              even the strongest stroke pixel fails, the target definitively
//              fails, and no reviewer has to argue about antialiasing.
//   renderP50 — the median ink pixel: closer to what the eye integrates over a
//              whole word, and always the grimmer number at small sizes.

// way of "handling" it was to find a stranger's browser and carry on.
//
// This is the one-line half of the port work. The HARNESS half — release-shots
// pinning 9431 while serve() bumps its HTTP port, so a second run drives the

// ONE HOME for launching a browser: tools/browser.mjs owns the profile, pins
// Chrome's own TMPDIR inside it, and removes it whatever happens. This tool used
// `/tmp/ca-profile-<pid>` — deterministic, never removed, one directory per run
// forever — which is the same leak the mkdtemp tools had without even a random
// suffix to make it look accidental.

// Both flags below are load-bearing, not tidiness. Without --disable-lcd-text,
// subpixel antialiasing paints COLOURED fringes around every glyph: a solid
// `--panel` box that computes to rgb(36,29,21) captured pixels as far off as
// #2e3635, which fed a teal "backdrop" into the ratio and moved answers by
// ~0.9. Greyscale AA also makes the small-type story a pure-luminance one,
// which is the claim being made. --force-color-profile=srgb stops the capture
// being colour-managed on the way out, so a captured pixel equals the computed
// pixel — verified: #241d15 in, #241d15 out.
