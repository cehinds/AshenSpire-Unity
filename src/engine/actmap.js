// src/engine/actmap.js — the ONE act-boot path: generate the act's map, then
// pre-roll every unknown (?) node (EldenSpire#54).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. This sequence used to live three times — main.js
// buildActMap(), tools/runsim.mjs's per-act loop, tools/session.mjs buildMap()
// — three copies of one fact with nothing checking they agree. When
// resolveUnknownNode grew its required `act` argument, the change reached
// main.js and neither harness: the game was fine while the completability
// evidence machine exited 1 on every run (fix/harness-act-plumbing, 5caf115).
// A signature can only be hand-carried to N copies N ways; with one copy there
// is nothing to carry. Game and harnesses MUST import this — a new caller that
// inlines the sequence is reintroducing the defect class this file deletes.
//
// SEEDING CONTRACT (deliberate, and callers depend on it): draws happen in
// exactly the order the three copies made them — the 'map' stream inside
// generateActMap, then one 'events'-stream roll per event node in
// Object.values(nodes) order, each resolved event id joining the no-repeat
// list. Extraction changed the home of this code and not one draw, so
// existing seeds replay identically (gated: runsim/session-smoke green at the
// extraction commit).
//
// Headless: pure function of (registries, rng, act) — no DOM, no storage.

/**
 * buildActMap(registries, rng, act, mapShape, { history }) → mapGraph
 *
 * `history` is the run's choice history at map birth (quest steps, E12): an
 * event gated on an earlier choice enters this act's Unknown nodes only once
 * that choice was made — so an act answers the acts before it. Absent ⇒ the
 * ungated pool, byte-for-byte today's act for every existing seed.
 *
 * `act` is the CONTENT act (the caller answers Endless looping — main.js and
 * the tools pass their contentAct), required for the same reason
 * resolveUnknownNode requires it: guessing act 1 would be a default nobody
 * authored. Unknown (?) nodes come back with `.resolved` already set, so a
 * node's outcome is seed-determined at map birth and the Sealstone Key can
 * reveal it (SPEC §6).
 *
 * `mapShape` is the Custom Climb debug shape (`run.custom.mapShape`) or null.
 * It is applied HERE, in the one act-boot path, for exactly the reason this file
 * exists: a per-run override applied at each of the four call sites would be
 * four copies of one fact, and the fourth would be the one that forgets. Absent
 * ⇒ byte-for-byte today's act, so every existing seed replays unchanged.
 *
 * A shape that does not resolve THROWS and names the knob. The screen refuses
 * it before the run starts (ui/screens/customRun.js), so reaching this throw
 * means a shape arrived from somewhere the screen does not guard — a hand-edited
 * save, a future caller. That is precisely when a loud failure is worth its cost.
