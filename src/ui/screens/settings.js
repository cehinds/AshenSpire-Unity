// back both the standalone modal (openSettings) and the in-run overlay's

// section rendered a LONE HEADING — the author did the data-driven thing and got
// a promise with nothing behind it, in silence.
//
// So the list is no longer authored. A category EXISTS because something is
// filed under it: a `cat:` on a row, or a section below. What stays authored is
// the ORDER, which is a design decision and not derivable — and a name in the
// order that nothing files under is a defect that fails by name at boot
// (assertSurfaces, src/ui/surfaces.js), not a heading over nothing.
//
// Adding a settings row under a brand-new category needs NO edit here: the
// heading appears, after the ordered ones, in the order its first row appears.
//
// SECTIONS are categories whose contents are code rather than rows.
// Profile is a title-screen route; Settings no longer duplicates that drawer.
// About carries the AI-use acknowledgement, rendered from its one home in
// src/content/aiDisclosure.js — the same text the store page shows (#69).
//
// `tip` IS THE ONE THING A SECTION HAS TO WRITE, and it is the honest edge of
// clause 7 on this screen. A category made of rows derives its tooltip from the
// rows filed under it — the author writes nothing. A section has no rows to
// read, so its one sentence is authored here, where its code already is. That
