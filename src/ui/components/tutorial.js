// src/ui/components/tutorial.js — first-run combat callouts (SPEC §7.4, §9 M4)
//
// A one-time guided overlay (≤4 dismissible callouts) shown on the player's
// first combat. Spotlights each key element and explains it; the "seen" flag is
// persisted in meta settings (main.js) so it never shows twice. Steps whose
// target isn't on screen (e.g. a Staggered enemy has no intent) are skipped.
//
// THREE INDEPENDENT EXITS, on purpose. `finish()` is the only thing that ever
// writes `seenTutorial` (main.js onTutorialDone), so an unreachable exit is not
// a cosmetic bug — it locks the player out of their first fight and survives a
// reload, because the flag is still unwritten. So: the buttons, the Escape key,
// and — the backstop that needs no geometry at all — a veil that does not eat
// the board's input (ui.css .tut-veil is pointer-events:none; only the bubble
// takes clicks). Even with every callout mispositioned, the player can play.

// `text` IS A FUNCTION WHEREVER IT NAMES A CONTROL, and that is the whole of the
// change here. The End Turn step shipped as *"Done? End Turn (or press E)."* — a
// hardcoded `E` in the FIRST THING a new player ever reads, which the first rebind
// orphans in the one place a player has no way to know it is lying (Law 1 clause
// 7). It derives from the live binding now, resolved at the moment the callout is
// SHOWN rather than at module load, so a rebind between boot and first fight still
// carries. `actionLabel` also answers the active device, so a pad player is told
// the glyph on the button under their thumb rather than a letter they cannot press.
//
// `press 1–9` in the Play-cards step is DELIBERATELY LEFT AS PROSE: the positional
// quick-play keys are not rows in ACTIONS, are not rebindable, and have no binding
// to derive from. Said here rather than leaving the next reader to work out which
// of the two rules applied to which line.
