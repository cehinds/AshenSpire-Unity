// src/ui/components/refusal.js — a control the player can SEE and cannot USE.
//
// Constantine, on his phone, 2026-08-07: "for armament, I can't select the empty
// slot to equip available weapons." The slot opened. What opened was seventeen
// armaments with sixteen locked, and A LOCKED CHIP HAD NO CLICK HANDLER AT ALL.
// He tapped a weapon he could plainly see, nothing moved, and the lock reason was
// a line of small text below the fold. A screen refusing without saying so reads
// as a dead control — which is exactly what he reported it as.
//
// THE PROPERTY: a control a player can see and cannot use must say WHY, WHERE
// THEY ARE LOOKING. Sunna's law failing at the moment it exists for.
//
// THE MECHANISM, and it is the shape of the thing rather than a fix for one
// screen: the reason is an ARGUMENT, not an afterthought. There is no way to
// mark a control as refusing without saying why, BECAUSE SAYING WHY IS HOW YOU
// MARK IT. A future screen cannot forget the explanation the way this one did,
// for the same reason a future refusal path in bundle.mjs cannot forget to leave
// the page: it never has to remember. Binding to the act, not to the caller.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not set `disabled`. A disabled
// button is unfocusable, untappable and silent — it cannot be asked. A refusing
// control stays reachable by pointer, by keyboard and by the pad focus cursor
// (input.js's FOCUS_SELECTOR takes `button:not([disabled])`), and answers all
// three: hover and focus through the shared tooltip, tap through this module.
// `aria-disabled` says the same thing to a screen reader WITHOUT removing the
// control from the tree, which is the whole difference.

/**
 * refusesWhen(el, reasonFn, otherwise) → refresh()
 *
 * The same property as refuses(), for a control that refuses SOMETIMES: BEGIN
 * THE CLIMB with an unusable seed typed into the field beside it. `reasonFn` is
 * read at every refresh and at every click.
 *
 *   reasonFn()  a string → the control refuses and this is why
 *               null/undefined → the control is usable; nothing is marked
 *   otherwise   the tooltip while it is usable (a function or a string).
 *               Required in spirit: this control has a tooltip either way, and
 *               attachTooltip may only be called once per element, so the two
 *               texts have to arrive together.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SIBLING AND NOT A REWRITE OF refuses(). The two disagree about
 * what "no reason" means, and the disagreement is real, not cosmetic. For
 * refuses() an empty reason is a DEFECT — the control refuses regardless and
 * says so on the console, which is what makes a silent refusal impossible to
 * write. For refusesWhen() an absent reason is the ordinary case: it means the
 * control works. Folding them would make one of those two meanings unsayable.
 *
 * It does NOT block the click on its own. It says why, and the screen's own
 * handler asks reasonFn the same question — one home for the condition, and no
 * dependence on which listener happens to be registered first.
