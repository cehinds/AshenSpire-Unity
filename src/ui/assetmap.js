// Every rendered image is referenced by a path built at runtime
// (`assets/equipment/weapon_${id}.webp`), so no bundler can find them by
// reading the source. This map is the answer: tools/bundle.mjs REPLACES the
// empty object below with { path: 'data:image/webp;base64,...' } for every file
// under assets/, and assetUrl() prefers it.
//
// Served from a directory the map stays empty and the browser fetches files
// normally — which is what you want in development, since a 1 MB inlined blob
// would have to be re-read on every reload.
//
// This file is the ONLY place that knows the difference between the two, and
// the bundler's replacement is anchored on the exact line below.
