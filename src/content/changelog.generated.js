    "detail": "Nothing a player sees changes. Eleven pull requests had landed on dev with no entry in this file, and because the changelog inside the game is built from this one, each was missing for a player too. None of them broke anything, which is exactly why it kept happening: an unreceipted merge is green, ships, and reads as finished. Three separate passes — #633, #641 and #653 — existed only to go back for them. A gate now refuses a promotion whose merges are not all named here, and it runs on every push to dev. It checks coverage, not prose: whether an entry exists for each merge, never whether what it says is true. It also guards itself — if this file's receipt syntax ever moves out from under it, it reports that it could not run rather than declaring every merge unreceipted. The cheap pull-request lane also gains the import check that walks every module in the tree.",

Six merges had landed on dev with no receipt in this file — the music-parity gate (#645), the animated outfit figures (#648), the Quick Access alignment (#649), the build-version corpus (#650), the hand-side instrument and the defect it found (#651), and the uniform stat foldouts (#647) — so the changelog you can read inside the game carried none of them either. All six are written up below, each at the build standing at its own merge, and the projection was regenerated from this file so both now say the same thing. Two of those receipts state something a green summary would have hidden: #647's own new gate reports 33 of 34, not the 34 its description claimed, and #651's repair exposed a rendering defect that is still on dev. The README's feature list also now says that the armour you equip changes the animated figure you fight as, which #648 made true and no player-facing page had mentioned.

    "summary": "Every stat row is the same row, and only one of them is open",
    "detail": "Character creation, the shrine's Assign Points fold and the Armoury's Attributes card now draw the five primary stats — STR, DEX, CON, WIS, INT — as one compact family instead of three treatments that had drifted apart. Opening one stat's reveal closes whichever was open, across rows the game renders separately, so the column no longer grows a stack of open explanations you have to close by hand. The Armoury's Character information cards behave the same way and arrive with Attributes already open. A narrow Armoury attribute row keeps its rows level and still shows the whole number rather than clipping it. Stated rather than buried: the gate this change adds does not fully pass. tools/uniform-stat-foldouts.mjs reports 33 of 34, and the one that fails is the mobile Assign Points row — INT sits 1.44px taller than the other four, because it carries the longest summary and that surface is the narrowest of the three. It reproduces on the head before this branch merged dev, so it is not merge damage, and the tool is not wired into CI, so nothing goes red for it. Whether that is a layout defect or an assertion that wants a tolerance is the owner's call, and widening the tolerance to make the number read 34 would have hidden the question.",

The gate that checks which side of the figure a weapon is drawn on read content/source/weapons.csv by position, and the third-normal-form pass moved artKey from column 17 to 16; the tool read a number where the art key should be, found no art for any weapon at all, and died before measuring anything. CI had been reporting that death for as long as the drift had stood. The column is corrected, and the contract is now asserted against the file's own header row rather than assumed, so the next move announces itself. The working instrument then reported that the Armoury's figure and combat's figure disagree by 184px on the same weapon — every individual placement is right, the pairing is not — and bisecting with only the column fix applied puts the cause in #618, which is precisely the change about which way a sprite faces. The rendering defect is deliberately not fixed here, because it needs its own diagnosis in a real browser and folding it into an instrument repair would bury both. The job stays red, now for a true reason rather than a broken one.",

One was worse than merely dead — it asserted the presence of something the current rule wants gone, so satisfying it made the tree more correct and it could never go red. The three are replaced with one plant per way the row that actually exists can break, including a guard against the #620 regression itself. Thirty-five of thirty-five known-bads now come back red.",

The attack gains a fourth frame: the forward thrust now lands before the downward slash instead of the swing starting mid-air. Twelve new painted pose sheets back this, cut into 720 frames and shipped as 560; the single-file download grows accordingly. The sheets were generated with ChatGPT Codex under the owner's direction — CREDITS says so, the source sheets and the approved outfit boards are kept in docs/art-evidence/2026-09-05/, and the game's AI disclosure covers them like every other painted figure.",

Dispatching CI against test before the promotion turned up a failure on all three runners: the check that the music-only switch reflects its own state was matching the exact source text of the old imperative call, and the component-kit rewrite (#605) had moved that row onto the kit's declarative form. The behaviour never broke; the sentence the gate was reading did. Worse, the plant that proves the gate can fail searched for the same vanished string, so the gate was red and proving nothing — the two failure modes that are supposed to be distinguishable, at once. Both halves now assert what the value derives from rather than how it is spelled, and the freed drift slot is recorded in the plantsites baseline so the counts still match. Pre-existing rather than introduced: it reproduces on release and on the earlier test.",

Reduced motion now honours the setting made in your operating system and not only the one inside the game, which in co-op was the only gate a pose swap passed through. Two co-op seats of the same class and tint now rotate through their attack frames independently instead of stealing each other's place. The remaining four are in the art tools: the gap check is per class and pose rather than pooled across all of them, a failed encode no longer leaves the shipped set half-deleted, --grounded anchors a figure by its feet rather than by its lowest ink, and a crop with nothing above the floor line names the frame instead of throwing a bare RangeError.",

The stable Play link is deliberately not automated: a push to main publishes nothing, and that link moves only on the owner's own dispatch.

The garment takes the hue of the tint you chose while keeping the painting's own light and shadow, so the cloth changes colour without going flat; steel, bone and the dark inside a hood keep their own colour, because a dye does not touch those. The accent rim on the silhouette stays, so the figure that glows is still yours. Settings and the LAN lobby call this style Rendered, as before; its description now says \"The painted class figure\". In a fight you are now drawn as that same painted figure. Combat used to composite a low-poly Blender body in your armour set's colours, so the character builder showed one figure and the fight drew another in a different style — and the Rogue fought as the Reaver's shape repainted. The armour-set palette and the held-weapon overlay no longer show on the fighter; your weapons still show on your cards and in the Armoury. Enemy figures and act backdrops are unchanged too. These four figures were made with an AI image-generation model (ChatGPT Codex) — the game's AI disclosure and CREDITS say so, and the disclosure was rewritten and re-approved because the previous text said no image model had been used.",

Before the elites was not: on most maps an elite stood with no Shrine anywhere below it, because one rule opened rests and elites on the same floor and so a rest could never sit under the first elite. Rests now open earlier than elites do, and a map that holds an elite holds a Shrine on some floor beneath it — measured across the generated maps, from 124 of 180 breaking that to none. The floor elites begin from has not moved, but the maps have: rolling a rest earlier changes what every node above it rolls, so a seed you have played before now draws a different map, elites included. What a run gains is about one more Shrine on the map, and the levels you buy at them are unchanged, because cinders were always the limit rather than the number of Shrines. The route is still yours: a path can climb past a rest and meet the elite anyway. Debug riders on the Custom Climb screen: the shortest act the slider offers is now 7 floors rather than 4, because a shorter act has no floor free to hold the promised rest.",

A reward with nowhere to go — a full flask belt, a full armament bag — says so on its own row before you tap it, and it is the only kind of row that offers Skip. Continue is always pressable and says what it will do; Settings → Advanced → Reward collection decides which: Auto (the default) takes everything you did not skip, picking a card for you, while Manual means done — only what you chose comes along. Continue is a press-and-hold on mouse, touch, keyboard, and pad.",
