// src/model/rewardplan.js — the reward MENU as a derivation (E11, #256).
//
// Constantine, 2026-08-15: "the reward should start with an initial menu of
// reward types (card, potion, armament)". And his answer on the card's page:
// Continue is ALWAYS pressable and a setting decides what it means —
// auto-collect ON takes everything, picking at random where there is a choice;
// OFF gives only what was chosen, no nagging.
//
// WHY A MODEL FILE AND NOT SCREEN CODE (the levelUpPlan precedent): the screen
// draws rows and forwards taps; WHAT the rows are, which are blocked and why,
// and what Continue means under each mode is one derivation with one home, so
// the co-op renderer, the auto-collect path and any instrument all read the
// same answer. The screen decides nothing.
//
// THE ROWS ARE DERIVED FROM THE OFFER (Law 0: an entry DESCRIBES, the
// machinery DERIVES). A kind absent from the rewards object has no row. A new
// reward field on the offer is one ORDER entry and one descriptor row here —
// not a screen redesign.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO, stated: it never touches `run`, never applies a
// reward, never rolls its own randomness (the pick function is HANDED IN so a
// seeded run stays seeded), and never invents a seen-store (possessions are
// handed in too). Application stays with the caller, one seam.
