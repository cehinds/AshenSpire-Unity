// src/model/levelup.js — LEVELLING AT A SHRINE. Constantine, D10 wave 1:
//
//   "also at graces, players should have the option to level up their character
//    (per run) by trading cinders to level up. at level up they may increase a
//    stat by 1 point."
//
// and again in E13, with the acceptance test attached:
//
//   "rest sites become where you level, cinders spent past a threshold — 1 stat
//    point per level, 10–20 level-ups a run, scalable."
//
// WHAT LEVELLING TURNED OUT TO BE, because there was no level system in this
// tree to add to and the shape had to be derived rather than invented. There is
// no XP, no character level, no class progression, and nothing anywhere named
// `level`. What there IS, already, is the exact machinery a level-up needs:
//
//   `run.attributes`      five integers, the only growth surface the run has.
//   `content/derivedStats.js`  what a point is WORTH — CON → HP and Stamina,
//                         WIS → Mana, DEX → Actions, INT → Draw. E6 shipped
//                         this tonight.
//   `run.cinders`         the currency, already spent this way at the shop.
//
// So a level is not a new system. **A level is one attribute point, bought with
// cinders, at a shrine** — and every consequence of it is already derived by
// tables somebody else owns. This file adds a PRICE and a PURCHASE and nothing
// else: it authors no stat, no curve of HP, and no idea of what a point does.
//
// THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS, and it is the whole reason this is a model
// file rather than four lines in the shrine screen. Three separate mechanisms
// have to move together or the run breaks, and two of them break LATER:
//
//   1. the attribute goes up — the visible half;
//   2. the derived pools have to be re-derived from the run's OWN snapshot, or
//      the next load throws `Persisted maxMana N contradicts derived-stat
//      snapshot value N+1` (state.js:initializeRunDerivedStats);
//   3. `run.levelUps` has to record the purchase, or the creation-rule check at
//      the load door sees a 56-point allocation where the mode says 55 and the
//      save is ARCHIVED (attributes.js:grantedAttributePoints, save.js).
//
// A level-up that does only (1) looks perfect on screen and destroys the run on
// the next load. That is why this is one function and not a screen's business.

 * before the question was asked. So the predicate moves with `run.cinders` and

 *
 * It is still not a constant, and the fold must re-read it rather than cache it:
 * every purchase raises the next price, and every fight changes the purse.
 *
 * `pointsPerLevel` IS AN ARGUMENT, NOT A LOOKUP — Constantine, 2026-08-17:
 * "leave the level up value configurable". The caller resolves the player's
 * setting (`resolveLevelUpValue`, settings.js) and hands it in; omitted, the

 *
 * RE-DERIVED FROM THE RUN'S OWN SNAPSHOT, never from today's content tables.
 * `run.derivedStatRuleSnapshot` is what the run was born under and what its
 * persisted pools are validated against; re-deriving from `registries` would
 * hand a climb in progress whatever the tables say tonight — the exact drift
 * the snapshot exists to prevent.
 *
 * MAX-HP IS NOT COMPUTED HERE. `reconcileRunLoadoutHp` is max-HP home 3 of 3
 * and already does derived + equipment + adjustment with the deficit carried;
 * a fourth home doing the same sum is the second copy this tree keeps catching.
 *
 * WHAT A LEVEL DOES TO A CURRENT POOL, ruled rather than assumed: the pool
 * grows and **the deficit is carried** — levelling CON at 12/40 HP gives 12/41,
 * not a heal. A level-up is not a rest, the shrine already sells the heal
 * beside it, and a level that healed would make the Rest panel pointless at the
 * same counter. Mana, Stamina and the per-turn stats have no deficit to carry
 * inside a shrine (combat is over), so they take the new maximum.
 *
 * ⚠ `run.levelPoints` IS NOT A SECOND COPY OF `run.levelUps`, AND IT BECAME A
 * SECOND FACT THE MOMENT THE LEVEL VALUE BECAME A DIAL. Six levels at 1 point
 * and three levels at 2 points are the same nine points and a different number
 * of purchases; the COST RAMP indexes on purchases, the LOAD DOOR's allocation
 * check needs points, and there is no arithmetic between them once the dial has
 * moved mid-run. Deriving one from the other would need the value each purchase
 * was made at, which is a history nobody is keeping.
 *
 * AND IT IS WHAT DELETES THE HAZARD I SHIPPED THIS EVENING. `e05be89` had the
 * door multiply `levelUps × balance.levelUp.pointsPerLevel` — a LIVE content
 * read — so turning this dial would have re-priced every in-flight save's
 * expected total and archived runs at the next load. He has just told us he
 * intends to turn it repeatedly between test runs, which would have made that
 * the FIRST thing he hit. The run now records the points it was actually
 * granted, the door reads what the run recorded, and no setting can refuse a
 * save. A friendlier error message would have been the wrong fix.
