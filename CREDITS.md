# Credits & Asset Licenses

## Unity adaptation imports

The initial Unity slice reuses this repository's Reaver idle/attack poses,
Wandering Soldier and Blight Hound sprites, and Act 1 backdrop. PNG imports under
`Unity/Assets/AshenSpire/Resources/Art` are format conversions made by
`tools/convert-unity-art.py`; the tool checks decoded-pixel equality with the
original WebP files. The original provenance and license rows below still apply.
No new third-party artwork was introduced for this checkpoint.

The native foundation additionally imports the original four sprite styles from
`cehinds/AshenSpire` at `b17a7f4543e1710f49fae8b58880121690a314de`:
560 cropped class/armour/tint pose frames, 20 class/tint paintings and 20 raster
renderings of the original classic SVG silhouettes. These are the same project
assets and provenance described below. Their 600 output hashes are recorded in
`UnityTests/SpriteStyles/asset-receipts.json`; 580 WebP-to-PNG conversions were
checked for decoded-pixel equality. Classic SVG rendering and native vector
sigils are documented separately from pixel-equality claims. No new external art
provider is introduced by this port.

Every third-party asset shipped in this repository is listed here with its source and license. **A PR that adds an asset without a row in this file does not merge.**

## Assets in use

**v1 ships zero *third-party* asset files.** The `.webp` files under `assets/` are this project's own, rendered by the Blender pipelines listed below — first-party, CC0, and each with a row here.

> **One exception, disclosed rather than absorbed.** The class sprites
> (`assets/sprites/{reaver,starseer,rogue,herald}_*.webp`) are not Blender
> renders. They are cut out from the class concept art at
> `docs/art-evidence/2026-09-03/concepts/*-concept-v1.png`, which is
> **AI-generated — produced with ChatGPT Codex for this project** (owner
> statement, 2026-09-03). They are first-party in the sense that they were
> commissioned for and by this project and no third party's asset file is
> redistributed; they are **not** hand-authored, and this file does not claim
> they are. `RUNBOOKS/art.md` §11 requires AI-assisted material to retain its
> available provenance, so it is stated here rather than left to inference.
>
> This closes the gap `assets/classes/SUCCESSOR-CONTRACT.md` §5.1 carried as a
> blocker from 2026-08-28: the creator was unrecorded, not unknowable. Every visual is generated at
runtime by `src/ui/assets.js` — the style guide's placeholder recipe (a tinted,
rounded panel + a Unicode glyph + the entity's name). This is a deliberate design
choice (SPEC §2.4): the game is fully playable and visually coherent with no
downloads, and real art can be swapped in later by mapping an id to a URL with a
row in the table below — no game-code changes.

| Asset | Used for | Source | Author | License |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Generated placeholder sprites | enemy / player / card / relic art (`src/ui/assets.js`) | original to this project | AshenSpire | CC0 |
| Class sprites (`assets/sprites/{reaver,starseer,rogue,herald}_*.webp`) | player figures, one WebP per class × accent tint; inline-SVG fallback when unavailable | **AI-generated with ChatGPT Codex** for this project, then cut out from the concept art at `docs/art-evidence/2026-09-03/concepts/*-concept-v1.png` — background removed, framed to 450×570, one accent rim per tint (regenerate with `node tools/concept-cutout.mjs`). The Blender builders in `tools/sprites-blender.py` still exist and still work, but no longer produce the shipped class art. | AshenSpire (AI-generated, ChatGPT Codex) | CC0 |
| Pose sprites (`assets/poses/*.webp`, and the full set in `art/poses/*.webp`) | the animated combat figure — one WebP per class/outfit × pose × accent tint, played by `src/ui/services/PoseAnimator.js` | **AI-generated painted pose sheets**: the four default 3×3 class sheets supplied by the owner are kept at `docs/art-evidence/2026-09-04/pose-sheets/*.png`; the twelve alternative-outfit sheets generated with ChatGPT Codex under the owner's direction are kept at `docs/art-evidence/2026-09-05/outfit-pose-sheets/*.png`, with approved outfit boards beside them in `outfit-previews/`. Cut into single-pose frames, dyed per tint and encoded by this repo's own tools (`tools/painted-poses.mjs` → `tools/pose-sprites.mjs` → `tools/pose-ship.mjs`); the exact commands are in `art/poses/README.md` and reproduce the committed files. They replaced the Blender figures from `tools/lowpoly-blender.py`, which still exists and still works. | AshenSpire (AI-generated, ChatGPT Codex) | CC0 |
| Painted Reaver attack (`assets/animations/reaver/default-greatsword/right/*.webp`) | 60-step right-facing attack for Wayfarer Plate + right-hand Greatsword; 16 byte-distinct frames with runtime repeats | **AI-generated with ChatGPT Codex** under the owner's direction, refined in the approved `reaver-attack-v1` sequence, deduplicated without altering pixels | AshenSpire (AI-generated, ChatGPT Codex) | CC0 |
| Enemy sprites (`assets/sprites/enemy_*.webp`) | enemy figures | procedurally modeled + rendered by this repo's own Blender pipeline (`tools/sprites-blender.py`, headless; regenerate with `blender --background --factory-startup --python tools/sprites-blender.py -- assets/sprites`) | AshenSpire | CC0 |
| Act backdrops (`assets/bg/bg_act{1,2,3}.webp`) | act-map and combat backgrounds | procedurally modeled + rendered by this repo's own Blender pipeline (`tools/backdrops-blender.py`, headless; regenerate with `blender --background --factory-startup --python tools/backdrops-blender.py -- assets/bg`) | AshenSpire | CC0 |
| Equipment + armour-set art (`assets/equipment/*.webp`) | weapon layers and per-class/per-set bodies, composited at runtime | procedurally modeled + rendered by this repo's own Blender pipeline (`tools/equipment-blender.py`, headless, reading the same `content/source/weapons.csv` + `outfits.csv` the game reads; regenerate with `blender --background --factory-startup --python tools/equipment-blender.py -- assets/equipment`) | AshenSpire | CC0 |
| Equipment component reference strips (`assets/equipment/components/v1/**/*.webp`) | five-view modeling and inventory-art references for 39 class equipment components | generated for this project from project-owner-supplied character paintings; indexed by `assets/equipment/components/v1/manifest.json` | AshenSpire | CC0 |
| Painted equipment turnaround sheets (`docs/low-poly-fighters/*.png`) | the eight reference sheets on the *Low-Poly Fighters — Painted Poses* page (`docs/low-poly-fighters/index.html`) — every equipment piece per class in five orthographic views (top, right, bottom, left, back), two sheets per class: the garments and the kit (hands, feet, weapon) | **AI-generated** painted sheets supplied by the owner (owner statement, 2026-09-05), delivered as `{knight,monk,rogue,wizard}-{wearables,equipment}-turnaround.png` and renamed on commit to the names the page reads. Reference only — nothing loads them at runtime; the shipped per-piece equipment art is the `assets/equipment/*.webp` row above. The painted **pose** sheets that page also shows are covered by the *Pose sprites* row. | AshenSpire (AI-generated) | CC0 |
| Unicode emoji glyphs (⚔ 🩸 💎 ☄ …) | card/relic/status/enemy icons, sigils | Unicode standard; rendered by the player's OS/browser emoji font | Unicode / OS vendor | Not embedded — system-rendered |
| Cinzel (display), Inter (body) | typography | referenced by `font-family` with robust system fallbacks (Georgia / system-ui); **not bundled** in v1 | Google Fonts | SIL OFL (when self-hosted) |

> When real art lands: download from a **Planned source** above, place it under
> `assets/`, reference it from `src/ui/assets.js`, and add a row here (source URL,
> author, license). Self-host the Cinzel/Inter `woff2` under `assets/fonts/` with
> an `@font-face` block and a row here — the fallbacks keep the game readable
> until then.

## Unity campaign artwork and sound

The Unity campaign reuses the original Reaver, Rogue, Herald and Starseer pose art and three act backgrounds. The twelve `painted_*` enemy sprites were generated for this adaptation using the built-in image-generation tool. Their original atlas, exact prompt, extraction manifest and source SHA-256 are preserved in `GameContent/Unity/Art`. `tools/import-enemy-atlas.py` normalizes the transparent sprites to one scale and foot anchor. Original enemy files remain intact.

Combat feedback tones are synthesized by `GameAudio.cs` from the campaign Audio record; no external sound recordings are included.
